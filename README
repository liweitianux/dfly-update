A simple tool to update a DragonFly BSD system using binary releases or
snapshot builds.

This tool is written by the author to help keep the DragonFly BSD system
on a low-end VPS up-to-date, without consuming too much resources to build
and update from source, which may be even impossible for a small VPS.

Example
-------
An example output for updating DragonFly BSD from 5.0.2-RELEASE to the
latest master (v5.1.0.1010.gf2063-DEVELOPMENT) can be found in the
"example.log".
