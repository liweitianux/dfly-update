A simple tool to update the DragonFly BSD system from a pre-built system
image (e.g., ISO/IMG of a snapshot build or a release).

This tool is written by the author to help keep the DragonFly BSD system
on a low-performance KVM up-to-date, without consuming too much resources
to build and update from source.
