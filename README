A simple tool to update a DragonFly BSD system using binary releases or
snapshot builds.

This tool is written by the author to help keep the DragonFly BSD system
on a low-end VPS up-to-date, without consuming too much resources to build
and update from source, which may be even impossible for a small VPS.

Usage
-----
dfly# git clone https://github.com/liweitianux/dfly-update
dfly# cd dfly-update

* one step update:
  dfly# ./dfly-update fly

* step-by-step update:
  1. check local and remote status:
     dfly# ./dfly-update status
  2. use the above printed remote filename and md5 to download it:
     dfly# ./dfly-update <filename> <md5>
  3. mount the download image
     dfly# ./dfly-update /var/tmp/dfly-update/<filename
  4. backup the current kernel and world
     dfly# ./dfly-update backup
  5. install the new kernel, world, and config files
     dfly# ./dfly-update upgrade
  6. remove obsolete files, umount, and remove downloaded image
     dfly# ./dfly-update cleanup

NOTE:
after this, you still need to merge the listed config files with suffix
".__new__", and also upgrade the packages.
